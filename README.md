# RealmSwitchTimer
C# Project to estimate the amount of time on the realm switch timer for the Phoenix DAoC freeshard

If you want to simply use the tool, download the following three files and place them in your DAoC installation directory:

RealmSwitchTimer/bin/release/RealmSwitchTimer.exe
RealmSwitchTimer/bin/release/RealmSwitchTimer.exe.config
RealmSwitchTimer/bin/release/RealmSwitchTimer.pdb

Then double-click on the RealmSwitchTimer.exe are you are all set to go!

If you would like to build the tool from source, either clone or download the entire project.
You can then either open the project in Visual Studio to edit and build it, or you can just use the .NET build tools to build the C# project with the command:

C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe RealmSwitchTimer.csproj
